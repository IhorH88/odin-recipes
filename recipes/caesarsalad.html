    <p class="first-p">Parts you would need to make</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Romaine Lettuce – 1 large or 2 small heads of romaine lettuce. You can also use hearts of romaine. It’s best to buy the whole heads of lettuce and avoid pre-chopped, which has a shorter shelf life and won’t stay as crisp as freshly cut lettuce.</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese – freshly grated, shredded, or shaved parmesan will have better flavor and texture than pre-shredded (and there are no additives or preservatives).</li>

            <li>Crisp croutons – sliced baguette baked with parmesan; these are irresistible and you’ll have enough for 2 salads, so you can stash some for the next Caesar salad. You can also use Sourdough bread to make Sourdough Croutons.</li>
            <li>Homemade Caesar Dressing – this is a light homemade dressing and just takes a few minutes to whisk together and you don’t need eggs or anchovies. If you prefer a creamy dressing, our Creamy Caesar Salad works wonderfully for this salad (which is a favorite with all of the kids in my family).</li>

        </ul>
    <p class="lettuce">Romain lettuce</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse in Cold Water – keeping the lettuce cold will keep it crisp.
            <li>Start with Dry Leaves – my salad spinner is my best friend. Chop, rinse and spin dry the leaves to remove as much water as possible. It’s a major time-saver, and it does a better job of drying.</li>
            <li>Chill Lettuce Before Using – Once the romaine is rinsed and dried, store it in an airtight container or a zip-top bag with a paper towel to absorb moisture.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="croutons">Crunchy croutons</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut the baguette in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4″ thick pieces and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil with minced garlic. Toss the croutons with garlic-infused oil and 2 Tbsp finely grated Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Spread them evenly onto the baking sheet and bake until crisp and golden at the edges. If you want to store these for later, bake until they are fully dried out.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="dressing">Caesar Salad Dressing</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Whisk together minced garlic, Dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice, and red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Whisk constantly while adding oil to emulsify the dressing for a smooth and creamy (not oily) consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or to taste.</li>li
        </ul>
    <p class="mix">Finish up and mix it up</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your prepared romaine lettuce, top with croutons and parmesan.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, drizzle with your dressing, and toss gently to coat the lettuce and croutons.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="addon">Make-Ahead Tips</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce Prep – Chop, rinse, and spin dry the lettuce, transfer to a zip-top bag or airtight container with a paper towel, and refrigerate. It will stay crisp for 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>Storing Croutons – Bake 1-2 days ahead, cool completely before storing in an airtight container at room temperature to keep them crisp.</li>
            <li>Dressing can be made 3-4 days in advance. Store in a jar in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature if it has solidified and whisk to recombine before serving.</ul>
